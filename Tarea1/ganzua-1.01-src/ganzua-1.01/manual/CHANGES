                                CHANGES

V 1.01
~~~~~~
  Fixed two problems related to the XML Schema 1.0 Specification Errata,
  specifically with errata E0-21 and E0-28.

  E0-21 changed how complex types are derived by restriction, so the schema
  Cryptanalysis.xsd had to be changed.

  E0-28 specifies that the hint in the schemaLocation attribute must be a
  URI. Version 1.0 used a canonical path when writing language frequencies
  and project documents, so LangFreq.java and Analyzer.java were changed.

  It was found that the program does not work properly (can not find the
  schemata) when installed in a path that contains a directory with
  characters outside the English alphabet or 0-9. The problem seems to be
  in the implementation of JAXP and to be related to the RFC 2396: Uniform
  Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax.

  The manual and example files were modified to reflect the changes and
  provide a workaround to the problem.

V. 1.0
~~~~~~
  First version
